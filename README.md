# Yet Another VIm Run commands (or 'config', if you would)

Everybody does it! I mean, throws their hand-picked pile of befuddled Vim
goodness onto the internets. Yes, that is all.

## Intro

What is this!? (something should be written here, I know).
Also, notate bene.

## Installation

Voodoo magic:

    wget -qO- https://github.com/Xifax/yavir/raw/master/yavir.sh | sh

You may also just clone repo and symlink vimrc:

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/Xifax/yavir.git .vim
    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
    vim

When launched, it will get Vundle (you should have your *git*), then proceed
to install all the bundles (edit those, before launching, will ya?).

## Notes

Regarding plugin selection and possible customizations.

## Keymappings

Described in config itself. May (or may not) duplicate those here.

## TODO

* semi-autoinstall
* debug
* add some shiny things
* remove all the clusterfuck(s)
* and so on
